# Graph Algorithms Project

This project implements a Graph class and various graph algorithms in C++. It provides functionality for creating, manipulating, and analyzing graphs.

## Features

- Graph representation using adjacency matrix
- Basic graph operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- Graph comparison operators
- Various graph algorithms:
  - Bipartite Graph Check
  - Cycle Detection
  - Connectivity Check
  - Shortest Path Finding
  - Negative Cycle Detection

## File Structure

- `Graph.hpp` and `Graph.cpp`: Define and implement the Graph class
- `Algorithms.hpp` and `Algorithms.cpp`: Define and implement various graph algorithms
- `main.cpp` (not provided): Contains the main function to run and test the project
